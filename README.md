"Hacking statistics" 
In sports, parameters are always loosely defined (Eg. what happens when we keep the ball on the left side fo the court against a smaller defender). I wanted to keep a "random repositiory" constantly open as I continually upload ways we hack these problems in Python. The answer? 
Designing micro experiment that we can trial to see the variance, distribution, and outcomes of these questions over time. A repository designed to try to win the aggregate, this is how we beat the casino.
